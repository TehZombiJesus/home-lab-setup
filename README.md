# Privacy-Focused Home Lab Setup

A comprehensive home lab with gaming servers, media automation, and document management capabilities, designed for networks with ISP port restrictions.

## What This Provides

**ðŸŽ® Gaming Infrastructure**
- Minecraft servers (Paper, Fabric, Forge, Modpacks)  
- Rust servers with automated wipe schedules
- Discord bots and game management via Pterodactyl
- and more services potentially

**ðŸ“º Media Ecosystem**
- Usenetâ€¯only â€“ all mediaâ€‘automation traffic will go through a TLSâ€‘secured Usenet provider.
- Complete Plex media server with hardware transcoding
- Automated downloading and organization (Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr)
- Mobile access and international content support

**ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security**
- Network-wide ad blocking with AdGuard Home
- Zero Trust authentication via Cloudflare
- Canadian privacy-focused backup providers (not sure if OVH falls into that category)

**ðŸ“Š Management & Monitoring**
- Web-based administration for all services
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automated backup procedures
- Document management with OCR capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- HP EliteDesk 800 G5 with 64GB RAM and RAID 1 storage
- Domain name registered (for Cloudflare tunnels)
- 5 free Ubuntu Pro licenses (available to all Ubuntu users)
- VPN provider subscription for secure downloads

### Installation Process
**[ðŸ“– Complete Installation Guide](docs/installation/README.md)**

The installation is broken into 4 phases:

1. **[Foundation](docs/installation/phase-1-foundation.md)** - Proxmox & TrueNAS storage (2-3 hours)
2. **[Docker Services](docs/installation/phase-2-docker-services.md)** - Container platform & core services (1-2 hours)  
3. **[Gaming & Media](docs/installation/phase-3-gaming-media.md)** - Entertainment infrastructure (2-4 hours)
4. **[Security & Monitoring](docs/installation/phase-4-security-monitoring.md)** - External access & monitoring (1-2 hours)

Each phase includes detailed rollback procedures and validation steps.

## Important Design Decisions

### ISP Port Restrictions
This setup is specifically designed for ISPs that block incoming ports (25, 53, 55, 77, 135, 139, 161, 162, 445, 1080, 4444). **Standard port forwarding will not work** - all external access uses Cloudflare tunnels.

### Web-First Administration
All management is performed through web interfaces - SSH access is not required for day-to-day operations. This makes the system accessible from mobile devices and simplifies remote administration.

### Privacy Focus
European providers are used for offsite backups, VPN protection covers all downloads, and services are isolated between VMs to prevent cross-contamination.

## System Specifications
