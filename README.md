# üè† Home Lab Setup - tehzombijesus.ca

A comprehensive privacy-focused home lab with gaming servers, media automation, and document management capabilities.

## üéØ Overview

This home lab setup provides:
- **Gaming servers** (Minecraft, Rust, Discord bots) for friends-only access
- **Media automation** and streaming (self-hosted Spotify replacement)
- **Document management** with OCR capabilities
- **Network-wide ad blocking** and DNS management
- **Secure remote access** without exposing home IP
- **Privacy-focused** alternatives to big tech services

All services are accessible through Cloudflare tunnels, bypassing ISP port restrictions and providing enterprise-grade security.
