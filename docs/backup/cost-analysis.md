```

### **Growth Headroom Calculation**

**Current Capacity Utilization:**
- Used: 47GB
- Break-even threshold: 338GB  
- Available growth: 291GB (620% increase possible)
- Time to break-even: **5-7 years** at current growth rate

**Projected Growth Scenarios:**

|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Conservative | 10GB/year | 29 years | Stay with OVH indefinitely |
| Moderate | 25GB/year | 12 years | Monitor and reassess in 2030 |
| Aggressive | 50GB/year | 6 years | Plan migration to Contabo in 2031 |

## ðŸ’¡ Cost Optimization Strategies

### **1. Aggressive Retention Policies**

**Traditional vs Cost-Optimized Retention:**

| Data Type | Traditional | Cost-Optimized | Storage Savings |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Configurations | 90 days | 30 days | 67% reduction |
| Documents | 90 days | 60 days | 33% reduction |
| VM Templates | 365 days | 120 days | 67% reduction |
| Music Incremental | 180 days | 60 days | 67% reduction |

**Annual Savings from Retention Optimization: $2.16**

### **2. Compression & Deduplication**

**File Compression Ratios:**
```
Compression Analysis:
â”œâ”€â”€ Configuration files: 85% reduction (text-heavy)
â”œâ”€â”€ Document exports: 70% reduction (PDF compression)
â”œâ”€â”€ Music files: 5% reduction (already compressed)
â”œâ”€â”€ VM templates: 40% reduction (sparse disk images)
â””â”€â”€ Average compression: 45% across all data types
```

**Storage Impact:**
- Raw data: 85GB
- Compressed: 47GB (45% reduction)
- **Cost savings: $4.40/year**

### **3. Intelligent Backup Scheduling**

**Cost-Optimized Backup Frequency:**

| Priority Level | Data Type | Frequency | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Music Library | Weekly incremental, Monthly full | Irreplaceable content |
| **High** | Documents | Daily | Business critical, small size |
| **Medium** | Configurations | Daily | Easy to recreate, small size |
| **Low** | VM Templates | Weekly | Can be rebuilt, large size impact |

**Frequency Optimization Savings: $1.80/year**

### **4. Lifecycle Management**

**Automated Data Lifecycle:**
```yaml
Lifecycle Policies:
  hot_storage: 0-30 days (frequent access)
  warm_storage: 31-90 days (occasional access)  
  cold_storage: 91+ days (archive only)
  
Transition Rules:
  - Move to warm after 30 days (planned for 2026)
  - Archive old VM templates after 90 days
  - Delete non-critical backups after 180 days
```

**Future Savings Potential: $8-12/year when lifecycle tiers available**

## ðŸ“± Cost Monitoring & Alerting System

### **Real-Time Cost Tracking**

**Monitoring Script (`ovh-cost-monitor.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Cost calculation and monitoring

CURRENT_USAGE=$(rclone size ovh-s3:homelab-backups --json | jq '.bytes')
MONTHLY_COST=$(echo "scale=2; $CURRENT_USAGE / 1073741824 * 0.009636" | bc)
ANNUAL_PROJECTION=$(echo "scale=2; $MONTHLY_COST * 12" | bc)

# Budget thresholds
MONTHLY_BUDGET=2.00
ANNUAL_BUDGET=20.00

# Alert logic
if (( $(echo "$MONTHLY_COST > $MONTHLY_BUDGET" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "ALERT: Monthly cost $${MONTHLY_COST} exceeds budget $${MONTHLY_BUDGET}"
    # Send email/webhook notification
fi

# Generate cost report
cat > /var/log/backups/cost-report-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt << EOF
OVH Storage Cost Report - $(date)
========================================
Current Usage: $(numfmt --to=iec $CURRENT_USAGE)
Monthly Cost: $${MONTHLY_COST}
Annual Projection: $${ANNUAL_PROJECTION}
Budget Utilization: $(echo "scale=1; $MONTHLY_COST / $MONTHLY_BUDGET * 100" | bc)%

Savings vs Contabo: $$(echo "scale=2; 39.11 - $ANNUAL_PROJECTION" | bc)
Break-even Usage: 338GB ($(echo "scale=0; 338 * 1073741824 - $CURRENT_USAGE" | bc | numfmt --to=iec) remaining)
EOF
```

### **Budget Alert Thresholds**

**Multi-Tier Alert System:**
```yaml
Budget Alerts:
  Green Zone: $0-1.00/month (normal operation)
  Yellow Zone: $1.01-2.00/month (monitor closely)  
  Orange Zone: $2.01-3.00/month (investigate growth)
  Red Zone: $3.01+/month (immediate action required)

Alert Channels:
  - Email: budget-alerts@tehzombijesus.ca
  - Uptime Kuma webhook
  - Daily cost reports in /var/log/backups/
```

### **Cost Trend Analysis**

**Monthly Cost Trending:**
```bash
# Track cost trends over time
COST_HISTORY="/var/log/backups/cost-history.csv"

# Append monthly data point
echo "$(date +%Y-%m),$MONTHLY_COST,$CURRENT_USAGE" >> $COST_HISTORY

# Calculate 3-month trend
TREND=$(tail -3 $COST_HISTORY | awk -F, '{sum+=$2} END {print sum/NR}')

# Project break-even timeline
GROWTH_RATE=$(tail -6 $COST_HISTORY | awk -F, 'NR>1{sum+=$3-prev} {prev=$3} END {print sum/5}')
MONTHS_TO_BREAKEVEN=$(echo "scale=0; (338 * 1073741824 - $CURRENT_USAGE) / $GROWTH_RATE / 1073741824" | bc)
```

## ðŸ”„ Cost Optimization Automation

### **Dynamic Retention Adjustment**

**Automated retention based on cost:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Adjust retention policies based on storage costs

CURRENT_MONTHLY_COST=$(get_current_monthly_cost)

if (( $(echo "$CURRENT_MONTHLY_COST > 1.50" | bc -l) )); then
    # Reduce retention when approaching budget
    CONFIG_RETENTION=21  # Down from 30 days
    DOC_RETENTION=45     # Down from 60 days  
    VM_RETENTION=90      # Down from 120 days
    
    echo "Cost optimization: Reduced retention policies activated"
elif (( $(echo "$CURRENT_MONTHLY_COST < 0.75" | bc -l) )); then
    # Increase retention when well under budget
    CONFIG_RETENTION=45  # Up from 30 days
    DOC_RETENTION=90     # Up from 60 days
    VM_RETENTION=180     # Up from 120 days
    
    echo "Budget headroom: Extended retention policies activated"
fi
```

### **Intelligent Compression Tuning**

**Cost-based compression strategy:**
```bash
# Adjust compression levels based on storage pressure
if (( $(echo "$CURRENT_MONTHLY_COST > 1.25" | bc -l) )); then
    COMPRESSION_LEVEL="9"  # Maximum compression
    COMPRESSION_METHOD="xz --extreme"
else
    COMPRESSION_LEVEL="6"  # Balanced compression/speed
    COMPRESSION_METHOD="gzip"
fi
```
